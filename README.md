# TCTL-for-cross-load-fault-diagnosis
This is Python code for our paper. The CWRU dataset is too large, please download it yourself if you are interested！

For JNU dataset（data_jnu）: The ReadData_JNU_5000.py is for sampling. The CNN_J.py is the model for jnu dataset. The mmd.py is used for domain alignment（MK-MMD） and the TCTL_jnu.py is for test model.

For CWRU dataset（data_cwru）：The ReadData200.py is for sampling. The CNN_C.py is the model for cwru dataset. The mmd.py is used for domain alignment（MK-MMD） and the TCTL_cwru.py is for test model.

I hope my code can help you, you can contact me if you have any questions！
